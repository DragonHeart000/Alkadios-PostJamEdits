This game was made for the GMTK-GameJam for 2020.

We had the first 2 levels finished and a cutscene at the end. The game was looking strong having made it in 48 hours. Unfortunantly when you build it out there was a bug we didn't find out about till about 15 minutes before the submission deadline. We had to submit with a version where the dialouge didn't work and the levels after level 1 did not work. It was very unfortunate.

If played in the editor the game worked totally fine.

I am going to archive this in the state that it was when we submitted. There will be a new version for one that fixes the bug and maybe goes further.
