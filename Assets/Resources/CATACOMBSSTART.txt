ALKADIOS: These tombs are much darker than the outdoors...

ELEOS: I mean - yeah.

ALKADIOS: But dimness, too, can be conquered! 

ELEOS: Yeah, I'm trying.

ALKADIOS: The name "Alkadios" shall be remembered forever!

ELEOS: Why are mortals so obsessed with their legacies? 

ELEOS: Having a title's not all it's cracked up to be. Signed, the "Goddess of Pity".

ELEOS: Sacred Tombs, by the way, interesting choice for the site of your heroic deeds.

ELEOS: Would've loved to see the strategy meeting behind that decision.

ELEOS: I wish you could hear me, because I'm getting some good shots in here.
