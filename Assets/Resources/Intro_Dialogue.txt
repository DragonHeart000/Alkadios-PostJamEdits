ALKADIOS: Hear me now - I, Alkadios of Thebes, swear to spread your glory to each and every corner of Hellas!

ALKADIOS: And so I offer my sacred prayers to the Gods of Mount Olympos.

ALKADIOS: Righteous Zeus, who rules the Heavens - let me be your sword!

ALKADIOS: Bounteous Poseidon, who keeps the seas - let me be your shield!

ALKADIOS: Stoic Hades, who keeps those now gone - let me be your reach!

ALKADIOS: And so the quest of Alkadios begins! The name "Alkadios" shall be remembered forever! Gods watch over me!

ATHENA:.....

HERMES:.....

ATHENA: Pffffff - 

HERMES: HA!

ATHENA: "And so the quest of Alkadios begins!"

HERMES: Stop, I'm gonna piss myself.

ATHENA: What a dork.

HERMES: You ever notice how mortals always pray to the big guys? Like they think they can just invoke Dad's name and get an audience with him pronto.

ATHENA: Hubris, is what it is.

HERMES: What do you think - who should I dump this on?

ATHENA: Kick it down to the minor leagues.

HERMES: God of Sleep, God of Blame, God of Doors - 

ATHENA: I got it - 

ATHENA: Eleos of Mount Olympos, I call thee forth!

ELEOS: You have summoned me, Lady Athena?

ATHENA: A most bold, most noble, most important prayer must be answered.

ELEOS:...Okay?

HERMES: Yea, the lady must steel herself in preparation for answering a prayer most crucial!

ELEOS: What?

ATHENA: Dost thou see that mortal? 

ELEOS: Yes?

ATHENA: Make sure he doesn't kill himself.

ELEOS: Uhhh - 

HERMES: We must away now, though I so wish we could take your place!

ATHENA: Alas, if only! But truly, an undertaking this noble could only be handled by the Goddess of Pity! 

HERMES: Farewell!

ELEOS:....Not JUST pity.

ELEOS: Alright, mortal, let's see what we can - 

ELEOS: Wait - 

ELEOS: Where's he going??
